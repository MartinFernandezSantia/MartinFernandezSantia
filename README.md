ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MartinFernandezSantia, a 20 years old argentinian who has been studying programming through several courses since mid 2021, and currently find myself learning at the ISFT204 institute in order to obtain a Software Developer degree.
My skills are mainly in Python, Django and SQLite3, although I have some experience handling other technologies like: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, C, and MySQL.
As for my English level, I have a certified degree by the CEM institute as a B2.

Although it is true that I don't have any work experience yet, I am looking forward to get it, since it would be a big step in my development as a programmer, 
both educationally and professionally.

Currently I have obtained a degree in Python 3.0 and another one in Django development from "Centro de e-learning UTN FRBA" with perfect grade, as well as the CS50x's Harvard Course certificate.
