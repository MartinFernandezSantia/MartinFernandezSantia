ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MartinFernandezSantia, I'm a 19 year ol argentinian who has been studying programming through several courses since mid 2021, and I'm about to 
enter CAECE University in Buenos Aires.
My skills are mainly in Python and SQLite3, although I have some experience handling other technologies like: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, C, and MySQL.
As for my English level, I am at B+.

Although it is true that I don't have any work experience yet, I am looking forward to get it, since it would be a big step in my development as a programmer, 
both educationally and professionally.

Currently I'm doing CS50x's Harvard Course and have obtained a degree in Python 3.0 from "Centro de e-learning UTN FRBA" with perfect grade.
